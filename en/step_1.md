## Introduction

Use Scratch to input real data on the type and amount of natural resources used by countries across the world to generate electricity. Then, compare the results using an animated data visualisation. Electricity is important. After all, it powers the computer you are using!

Electricity is generated from various natural resources which have an impact on the environment in different ways. Non-renewable energy is produced using finite resources, such as fossil fuels (coal, gas, and oil) and nuclear energy. Renewable energy can be produced by the wind (wind power), sun (solar energy), water (hydropower), ground (geothermal energy), and organic materials like wood and crops (bioenergy).  

This project engages with three of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:
+ [Affordable and Clean Energy](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-7-affordable-and-clean-energy.html){:target="_blank"}
+ [Responsible Consumption and Production](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-12-responsible-consumption-and-production.html){:target="\_blank"}
+ [Climate Action](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-13-climate-action.html){:target="_blank"}.

It uses data compiled by the International Energy Agency, with guidance kindly given by the Renewable Energy Foundation.

### What you will make

--- no-print ---

Click on the green flag to start the animation. Once it has finished drawing a series of colours, use your mouse or touchscreen to explore the resources that the colours represent. Then compare the use of renewable and non-renewable energy across the three countries.
