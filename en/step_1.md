## Introduction

Use Scratch to input real data on the type and amount of natural resources used by countries across the world to generate electricity. Then compare the results using an animated data visualisation. Electricity is important. After all, it powers the computer you are using!

Electricity is generated from various natural resources which impact on the environment in different ways. Non-renewable energy is produced using finite resources such as fossil fuels (coal, gas and oil) and nuclear energy. Renewable energy is produced from wind, solar (sun), hydro (water), geothermal (ground) and bioenergy (organic material including wood and crops).

This project engages with three of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:
+ [Affordable and Clean Energy](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-7-affordable-and-clean-energy.html){:target="_blank"}
+ [Responsible Consumption and Production](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-12-responsible-consumption-and-production.html){:target="\_blank"}
+ [Climate Action](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-13-climate-action.html){:target="_blank"}.

Using data compiled by the International Energy Agency, guidance was kindly given by the Renewable Energy Foundation.

### What you will make

--- no-print ---

Click on the green flag to start the animation. Once it has finished drawing a series of colours, use your mouse or touch screen to explore what resources the colours represent. Then compare the use of renewable and non-renewable energy across the three countries.
