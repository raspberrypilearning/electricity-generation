## Making graphs

For this project you will be making an animated and interactive data visualisation. It's often easier to understand data, especially lots of numbers, when they are represented visually. That why pie charts and graphs can be so informative. They also help you compare bits of information to one another. With computers, you can create exciting data visualisations which are animated or interactive. This project is both!

You'll create an animated and interactive data vsualistation, comparing electricity generated by three countries.

**Online:** open the [starter project](http://rpf.io/electricity-generation-on){:target="_blank"} in Scratch.
 
**Offline:** open the [project starter file](http://rpf.io/p/en/serene-scene-go){:target="_blank"} in the Scratch offline editor. If you need to, you can [download and install Scratch here](https://scratch.mit.edu/download){:target="_blank"}.

You should see a plain background titled "Electricity generation % 2019" and a horizontal line.

Run the project by clicking the green flag. An animation of a graph is drawn by an invisible pen showing New Zealand's use of resources used to generate electricity. You can then investigate the graph using your mouse.

New Zealand produce a lot of their electricity using hydro power with the result that there's a lot of blue in the graph drawn by the **New Zealand** sprite.

You are now going to create a graph for another country.

To copy the code for the **New Zealand** sprite, click on the **New Zealand** sprite whilst pressing the option key. sprites in the  project **Green goals**.

Change the value for hydro from 57 to 10. You will notice the amount of blue has reduced. It's these values whicha ffect the visuals in the graph.
