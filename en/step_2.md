## Making a graph about the UK

For this project you will be making an animated and interactive data visualisation. It's often easier to understand data, especially lots of numbers, when they are represented visually. That why pie charts and graphs can be so informative. They also help you compare bits of information to one another. With computers, you can create exciting data visualisations which are animated or interactive. This project is both!

You'll create an animated and interactive data vsualistation, comparing electricity generated by three countries.

--- task ---

**Online:** open the [starter project](http://rpf.io/electricity-generation-on){:target="_blank"} in Scratch.
 
**Offline:** open the [project starter file](http://rpf.io/p/en/serene-scene-go){:target="_blank"} in the Scratch offline editor. If you need to, you can [download and install Scratch here](https://scratch.mit.edu/download){:target="_blank"}.

--- /task ---

You should see a plain background titled "Electricity generation % 2019" and a horizontal line.

--- task ---

Run the project by clicking the green flag. An animation of a graph is drawn by an invisible pen showing New Zealand's use of resources used to generate electricity. You can then investigate the graph using your mouse.

New Zealand produces a lot of their electricity using hydro power with the result that there's a lot of blue in the graph drawn by the **New Zealand** sprite.

--- /task ---

You are now going to create a graph for another country, starting with copying the **New Zealand** sprite.  

--- task ---

Click on the **New Zealand** sprite whilst pressing the option key. Rename the new **New Zealand2** sprite to **UK**.

--- /task ---

If you run the project the **UK** sprite code will seem as it is not running even though it is. This is because it is running on top of the **New Zealand2** sprite. If you move the position of the **UK** sprite you will be able to see it working.

--- task ---

Go to the**Code** tab of the **UK** sprite.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Search for the `go to x: y:`{:class="block3motion"} block at the very top of the script which will have the values x: `-200` and y: `-140`. Change only the x value to `-20`:

```blocks3
go to x: (-20)y: (-140)
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---

Save your project.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Click the green flag. You should be able to see the **UK** sprite graph now on the right-hand side.

--- /task ---

You won't know it's a graph about the UK because the title is still hidden behind the **New Zealand** sprite. You now need to move the title so you can see it.

--- task ---

Go to the **Code** tab of the **UK** sprite. At the very end of the long script find the `go to x:`{:class="block3motion"} `-200``y:`{:class="block3motion"} `70` and change only the x value to `-20`:

```blocks3
go to x: (-20)y: (70)
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Save your project.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Click the green flag. You should be able to see the **UK** sprite title above the second graph. On no! It says "New Zealand".

--- /task ---

You need to change the text in the `say`{:class="block3looks"} block.

--- task ---

Go to the **Code** tab of the **UK** sprite. At the very end of the long script, below the `go to x:`{:class="block3motion"} `-20``y:`{:class="block3motion"} `70`, add a `say`{:class="block3looks"} block and type in `UK`:

```blocks3
go to x: (-20)y: (70)
say (UK)
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---

Click the green flag. You should be able to see the **UK** sprite title now above the second graph. Did you save your program?

--- /task ---

The graphs look the same because the **UK** sprite is still showing the energy values for the **New Zealand** sprite.

--- task ---

Go to the **Code** tab of the **UK** sprite. 

--- /task ---

--- task ---

You will find a series of `set`{:class="block3variables"} blocks which give a value to each variable. The value in each block represents the percentage (%) contribution of the listed resource to the overall total of 100. The current data is still from the **New Zealand** sprite. You need to replace the figures that are in the **UK** sprite program with the following figures in the blocks below:

```blocks3
set [nonrenewable v] to (64)
set [wind v] to (20)
set [solar v] to (4)
set [hydro v] to (2)
set [geothermal v] to (0)
set [bioenergy v] to (10)
```

The below also shows the same figures you need to input but this time in table form:

Resource Type | UK |
--- | --- |
**Non-renewables** | 64 |
**Wind** | 20 |
**Solar** | 4 | 
**Hydro** | 2 |
**Geothermal** | 0 |
**Bioenergy** | 10 |

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Run the program to compare what resourse the UK use to generate energy. You will notice the county UK uses less hydro and more bioenergy to generate electricity than the county New Zealand. The grey shows you how much non-renewable energy they use. How do the countries compare on the use of this resource?
