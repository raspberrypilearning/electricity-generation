## Step title

For this project you will be making an animated and interactive data visualisation. It's often easier to understand data, such as numbers, visually. That why graphs and pie charts can be so informative. They help you understand how the peices of information relate to one another. With computers, you can create exciting data  data visualisations which are animated or interactive. This project is both!

**Online:** open the [starter project](http://rpf.io/electricity-generation-on){:target="_blank"} in Scratch.
 
**Offline:** open the [project starter file](http://rpf.io/p/en/serene-scene-go){:target="_blank"} in the Scratch offline editor. If you need to, you can [download and install Scratch here](https://scratch.mit.edu/download){:target="_blank"}.

You should see a plain background titled "Electricity generation % 2019" and a horizontal line.

Run the project by clicking the green flag. An animation of a graph is drawn by an invisible pen showing New Zealand's use of resources used to generate electricity. You can then investigate the graph using your mouse.

New Zealand produce a lot of their electricity using hydro power with the result that there's a lot of blue in the graph drawn by the **New Zealand** sprite.

You are now going to create a graph for another country.

Change the value for hydro from 57 to 10. You will notice the amount of blue has reduced. It's these values whicha ffect the visuals in the graph.
