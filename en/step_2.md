## Set up the columns

For this project you will be making an animated and interactive data visualisation. It's often easier to understand data when it is represented visually, especially when it's lots of numbers. That's why pie charts and graphs can be so informative. They help you compare pieces of information to one another. With computers, you can create exciting data visualisations which are animated or interactive. This project does both!

You'll create an animated and interactive data vsualistation using a stacked column graph to compare the resources used by three countries to generate electricity.

**Online:** open the [starter project](http://rpf.io/electricity-generation-on){:target="_blank"} in Scratch.

**Offline:** open the [project starter file](http://rpf.io/p/en/serene-scene-go){:target="_blank"} in the Scratch offline editor. If you need to, you can [download and install Scratch here](https://scratch.mit.edu/download){:target="_blank"}.

You should see a plain background titled "Electricity generation % 2019" and, below, it a horizontal line.

Run the project by clicking the green flag. An animation of a column is drawn by an invisible pen. It shows New Zealand's use of resources used to generate electricity. You can then investigate the interactive column using your mouse.

New Zealand produces a lot of their electricity using hydro power which is why there's a lot of blue on the column graph.

You are now going to create a column for another country. To do this you will copy the **New Zealand** sprite.

Click on the **New Zealand** sprite and right-click to select **duplicate**.
