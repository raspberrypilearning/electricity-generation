Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select the **Paint** editor.

You may have noticed how the sprites seem invisible. The sprites use the `say`{:class="block3lookss"} block as a title but you cannot see the sprite itself. This is because the sprites are the same colour grey as the backdrop. You now need to create a sprite which is a grey square.

--- task ---

Go to the **Outline** tool and click the square with a red line through it to turn the **Outline** tool off.
