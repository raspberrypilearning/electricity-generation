## Making a third graph

In the this step you are going to start to create your own graph. 

--- task ---

Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select the **Paint** editor.

You may have noticed how the sprites seem invisible. The sprites use the `say`{:class="block3lookss"} block as a title but you cannot see the sprite itself. This is because the sprites are the same colour grey as the backdrop. You now need to create a sprite which is a grey square.

--- task ---

Go to the **Outline** tool and click the square with a red line through it to turn the **Outline** tool off.

Now add the following values in the **Fill** tool.

Color = 0
Saturation = 0
Brightness = 85

Now select the **Rectangle** tool and draw a small square.

Now that your new sprite is a grey square let's give it a name. Below is a table listing a number of countries and the percentage contribution of resources they  use to generate electricity. Choose a country to create a graph for. You could choose any country: one you are from (if it's not already represented), a neighbouring country, somewhere you've visited or what about a country which has uses a lot of one resource?

--- task ---

Investigate the table below, decide on which country you will now create a graph for, and rename **Sprite1** with the name of the country you have chosen.

Resource Type | UK | Norway | Indonesia
--- | --- | --- | --- 
**Non-renewables** | 100 | 100 | 100 
**Hydro** | 100 | 100 | 100 
**Marine** | 100 | 100 | 100 
**Geothermal** | 100 | 100 | 100
