## What next?

In this project, you have:

+ Organised your program using `My Blocks`{:class="block3myblocks"}
+ Used the `Pen`{:class="block3extensions"} extension blocks to draw stacked bar graphs 
+ Turned data on natural resources into colourful graphs that show how different countries generate electricity 

If you are following the [Protect our planet](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/protect-our-planet) pathway, you can move on to the [Turtle tracker](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/turtle-tracker) project. In this project, you will draw the routes of sea turtles using real data.
