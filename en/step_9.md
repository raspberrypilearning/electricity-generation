## What next?

In this project, you have:

+ Organised your program using `procedures`{:class="block3myblocks"}
+ Drawn with the `Pen`{:class="block3extensions"} extension block using `variables`{:class="block3variables"} and `procedures`{:class="block3myblocks"}
+ Turned real world data (numbers) into an animated data visualisation

If you are following the [Protect our planet](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/protect-our-planet) pathway, you can move on to the [Turtle tracker](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/turtle-tracker) project. In this project, you will draw the routes of sea turtles using real data.

If you want to have more fun exploring Scratch, then you could try out any of [these projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=scratch&curriculum%5B%5D=%201).
